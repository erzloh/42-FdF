FdF stands for "Fil de Fer" which means "wireframe model" in French. A wireframe model is a visual representation of a three-dimensional physical object used in 3D computer graphics. The purpose of the project is to make a project that renders a 3D wireframe model out of a text file as input. The input file contains the height value of each point.
